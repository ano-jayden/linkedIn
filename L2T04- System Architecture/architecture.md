architecture


.) An E-commerce platform would best suit a layered architecture. This approach splits the system into distinct layers: presentation 
   (UI), business logic, and database. Each layer handles a specific responsibility, making the system more maintainable, scalable, and testable. For example, integrating a new payment gateway would only affect the integration layer, leaving the other layers untouched.

.)In the medical industry, a repository architecture would be used because patient data can be separated to prevent mixing. This setup  
  can also lead to all patients' medical records being combined into a repository while still being independent of each other, allowing doctors to sort through them effectively.

.) Online banking would suit a client-server architecture because different clients would be able to access their own bank accounts 
   through different servers. They would be able to access this server virtually anywhere, provided they have internet access.

.) Scientific research would be an ideal case for pipe and filter architecture. If you are conducting a study, you could feed the 
   system raw data that can be transformed into useful data through the different filters in the system.

.) Layered architecture and pipe and filter architecture would fit together well. In layered architecture, you can modify one layer   
   while keeping the rest the same, whereas in pipe and filter architecture, you can change one filter while keeping all others the same.

.)Client-server architecture and repository architecture would fit well together because, in client-server architecture, all the data is stored on a network where users can access it, and in repository architecture, all the data is stored in a local repository that could also be stored on a network.
